# License server for Rizom Lab products, as Docker container

This container contains the LM-X server, plus the Rizom Lab vendor plugin. It allows you to run a license server for RizomUV from a container.

When deploying this, lock the container's MAC address to a fixed, unique address. Then use that address when purchasing floating licenses.
